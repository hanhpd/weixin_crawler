        <h5 class="w3-black">Glossary</h5>
        <p><span class="w3-text-green">Main / sub article：</span>The public account sends a single article in 1 + 7 mode. That is, 1 main article and up to 7 side articles. Usually the main article is the protagonist of this push, and the operator has the greatest expectation on the main article.</p>
        <p><span class="w3-text-green">Depth index：</span>The amount of likes divided by the reading of an article is the depth index of the article. In order to avoid the depth index being a small decimal, the result is multiplied by 1000 and the two digits after the decimal point are retained. Interpretation: The depth index is intuitively the ratio of likes to reading, and then magnified by 1000 times. A higher index indicates that a larger proportion of readers think the article has "depth".</p>
        <p><span class="w3-text-green">Drop index：</span>The reading of the previous article divided by the reading of this article is multiplying the quotient by 1000 and retaining two decimal places. The smaller the index, the greater the increase in reading this time. The reason behind this is worth exploring. A large drop index indicates a reverse fact.</p>
        <p><span class="w3-text-green">Review volume：</span>The number of comments is not the number of featured comments at the end of the article, but the total number of all comments, which is generally greater than the number of selected comments. Early public account may not have the message function enabled, so many early public account comments are 0.</p>
        <p><span class="w3-text-green">Reading data：</span>Reading data is a collective term for readers to add information to an article, including reading, likes, praises, and comments.</p>
        <p><span class="w3-text-green">median：</span>After a series of numbers is sorted by size, the number in the middle position or the average of the two numbers in the middle is the median.</p>

        <h5 class="w3-black">Table 1 Historical main article reading data</h5>
        <p>Statistics: Main article only</p>
        <p>Abscissa: date of posting, the earlier the time goes to the right. The rightmost end is the release date of the first main article, and the leftmost is the latest main article sending date in the statistics. In addition to the abscissa, there are three horizontal lines representing the maximum value, arithmetic mean, and minimum value in the window ( Same below)</p>
        <p>Vertical coordinate: Specify by clicking on the small rectangular color block above the table. Multiple selections are possible. Since the data may not be in the same order of magnitude, if multiple selections will cause the data of small order to be "overwhelmed", it is recommended to analyze them one by one.</p>
        <p>Note: The table contains the reading data of each article, and supports zooming and image saving. After narrowing down to a global perspective, you can clearly see the initial period, growth period, mature period, decline period, and fluctuation of the public account. The operator can clearly see the operation results of each stage in combination with the actual operation strategy. If there are a lot of 10W + articles that break the reading limit, it is recommended to use the amount of likes as the basis</p>

        <p>Ordinate: median, average (arithmetic average), maximum value of reading, likes, and comments</p>
        <p>Note: If the return of reading a sub-article is too low, you can consider reducing the number of sub-articles and shifting your energy to the main article. Which position of the sub-articles should be adjusted is the information that the table wants to express.</p>

        <p>Statistics object: statistics of main and auxiliary articles</p>
        <p>Abscissa: the three tables correspond to different main and vice articles, different publication weeks (1 for Monday, 7 for Sunday), and different publication hours</p>
        <p>Ordinate: number of articles</p>
        <p>Note: The relative number of articles of the main and subordinates indicates the amount of articles issued by the operating subject. Generally speaking, the number of main and auxiliary articles of the marketing account is relatively balanced, and there are fewer sub-articles in the public account of original content from the media. Week is the period of work and rest. Counting the number of posts in different weeks can express the operator's fit to the week cycle. 24 hours a day is the period of work and rest. The post hours express the operator's fit to the target reader's work and rest time.</p>

        <p>Abscissa: The abscissa of the three tables are the reading volume of this article</p>
        <p>Vertical coordinate: The upper left is the amount of likes, the upper right is the number of words in the article, and the lower is the reading amount of the previous main article</p>
        <p>Note: There is a clear linear relationship between the amount of likes and readings, indicating that the title of the article is in good agreement with the actual content (non-title party). And the abstract is drawn in, and the depth index is used later to describe it. The number of words in the article indirectly reflects the time cost of original content creation. Will the reading time increase as the authoring time increases? The easy index is used later to describe. If the reading volume of the previous article is very low and this time is high, it may be because of effective promotion methods or the content of the article is more popular. Otherwise, it indicates that the quality of this article has dropped, and the gap index is used to describe it later.</p>
